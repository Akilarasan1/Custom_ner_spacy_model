This project focuses on extracting detailed information about vehicles—such as name, model, color, brand, type etc., and range—using custom-trained Named Entity Recognition (NER). Built using the spaCy library, the model was trained on a dataset collected from various websites to identify entities that are often missing from standard NER models.
